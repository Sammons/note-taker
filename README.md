basic project using
* snowpack
* aws api gateway backed by aws lambda and dynamodb
* aws cloudfront backed by s3
* typescript
* material ui
* react
* mobx

...and some fun creative thoughts!

The scripts and code you might find here is not a full representation of the project, for simplicity some things were done by hand; creation/config for lambda, dynamo db, api gateway, cloudfront, iam, DNS (via cloundflare) were all done manually.
